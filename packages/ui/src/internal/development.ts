 * Whether development-only checks and warnings are on, as a runtime check.

 * It keeps a forgotten guard from warning in production, but it can't make a
 * bundle smaller: a bundler can't see through a function call, so the
 * message passed to {@link warnInDevelopment} would still ship. Every call
 * site therefore also guards itself inline, with exactly this expression,
 * which bundlers fold away when they replace `process.env.NODE_ENV`:
 *
 * ```ts
 * if (typeof process !== "undefined" && process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") {
 *   warnInDevelopment(`…`);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * `development.test.ts` checks every call site, and `build.test.ts` checks
 * that a production bundle drops the messages. Where nothing defines
 * `process`, such as a page loading the module directly, warnings are off.
